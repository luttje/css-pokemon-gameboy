# Pok√©mon GameBoy CSS

Inspired by: https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css

This is a joke CSS-framework and it is not intended for use in production. You can [see a demo here](https://luttje.github.io/css-pokemon-gameboy/). The demo performs poorly on mobile devices or small resolutions.


## Using the distribution

1. Copy all the files in the `dist/styles` directory to `styles` in your project

2. Append the following include on the page where you want this style:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/css-pokemon-gameboy.css">
```

3. See the [demo](https://luttje.github.io/css-pokemon-gameboy/), index.html or .scss-files for all possible classes and effects.


## Compile it yourself

### Compiling

1. Run `npm install`in the root directory

2. Run `npm run build` in the root directory to build a distribution

   -OR-

3. Run `npm run watch` in the root directory to watch for changes in the `src` directory and automatically build new distributions.
